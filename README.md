# Astro with GraphQL

In this example repo, you get the bare bones Astro starter pack, coupled with a simple GraphQL implementation using GraphQL Yoga and Apollo Client.

Astro is set to SSR mode to enable its API endpoint abilities, necessary to handle incoming GraphQL requests.

For a full walkthrough and tutorial on this project, check out [this blog post](https://robkendal.co.uk/blog/how-to-build-astro-site-with-graphql/) on my website.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ CartRow.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ cart.ts
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ types.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ apollo-client.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ main.css
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚     â””â”€â”€ api/
â”‚         â””â”€â”€ graphql.ts
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name. This project just has the one page, a homepage, located at `/pages/index.astro`.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where you can put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/data` directory holds some types and dummy data we can use with GraphQL.

In `src/lib` there's a really simple implemenation of Apollo Client, used to physically call our GraphQL endpoint.

With the `/src/pages/api/graphql.ts` file, this is where the GraphQL action happens. It uses GraphQL Yoga to create a schema, and defines a `POST` endpoint to handle incoming API requests.
